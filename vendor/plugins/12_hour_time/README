12-HOUR TIME PLUGIN

  Not all of us are adept at those exotic, 24-hour clocks. So for the rest of
  us, here's a simple plugin that tacks on an AM/PM selector to the DateHelper
  methods. It also handles the backend, so things are properly stored in
  24-hour format.

USAGE:

  <%= time_select 'event', 'time', {:twelve_hour => true} %>
